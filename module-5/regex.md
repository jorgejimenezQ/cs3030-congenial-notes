# REGEX

`Re`gular `ex`pressions are patterns used to search a text based on a set of defined patterns.

## When to use `REGEX`?

Regex provides a lot of power to manipulate text. However, it is confusing, and computationally expensive. Therefore, use it with caution.

Of course, there are times when using regex is encouraged:

- String validation
- Short String manipulation (When not natively supported by the language)
