# The WGET Command

Wget is used to retrieve content from the web servers.

## Some Common Options

```
-V, --version	Display the version of wget, and exit.
-h, --help	Print a help message describing all the wget's command-line options, and exit.
-b, --background	Go to background immediately after startup. If no output file is specified via the -o, output is redirected to wget-log.

-e command,
--execute command	Execute command as if it were a part of the file .wgetrc. A command thus invoked is executed after the commands in .wgetrc, thus taking precedence over them.
```
